# IV-Tube-Datasheet

The goal of this repository is to translate the available Datasheets to German (and finally to English).
The VFD tubes I want to translate are the IV-19, IV-21 and the IV17 tubes.

As a reference/starting point I may use https://github.com/blinken/nixie-clock/tree/main/datasheets/iv-18.

!!! The texts will be freely translated, sucht that they will be readable and easy to understand and still be as close to the source as possible.

In the future the included pictures will also be adapted and included and I have time, I will generate a pdflatex version.
